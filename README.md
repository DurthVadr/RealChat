For local testing:
1) Run the server.py file, make sure the server is started.
2) Change the IP written in client.py code (HOST = '<your_ipv4_address>'), Remove the <your_ipv4_address> part and add your own IPv4 address.
3) In another terminal, run the client.py code (You can run as many as clients you wish).
4) Connect to server in the opening window by writing your username and press "Connect".
